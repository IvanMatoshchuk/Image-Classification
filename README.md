## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

It is necesary to install "pytorch" and it is suggested to install "cuda", so that algorithm can be run on the video card. GPU can process linear computation ~100 times faster then CPU, so it will save a lot of time for us. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*. 

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

It is a basic image classifier for flowers open data set. 

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The ~500 Mb of different flowers images were used in training and testing the model.   Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found in the jupyter notebook provided in the repository.

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Kaggle for the data. Feel free to use the code here as you would like!
